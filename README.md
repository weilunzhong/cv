## Curriculum Vitae for Alan Orth
A CV written in LaTeX using the [moderncv](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) class.

### Sample
Here's what it looks like with real data, using the "classic" style and blue color scheme:

### Why
I decided to start keeping my CV in LaTeX because:

* I can never find my CV when I need it
* I have dozens of files named `resume.doc` on my computer
* LaTeX -> PDF ensures a consistent, beautiful layout
* Writing your CV in a source-based language means you can track it in git (w00t!)

### Usage
To "build" a PDF you simply type:

	make

To clean up all generated and intermediate content, type:

	make clean

### Pre-requistes for building
Depending on your GNU/Linux distribution the package names may be different.  Basically, you need the `texlive` package, as well as whichever "extras" package contains the moderncv stuff.

__On Arch Linux:__

	sudo pacman -Sy texlive-core texlive-latexextra

__On Fedora:__

	sudo yum install texlive texlive-moderncv


__On Ubuntu:__

     sudo add-apt-repository ppa:texlive-backports
     sudo apt-get install texlive
     sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install texlive-latex-extra
